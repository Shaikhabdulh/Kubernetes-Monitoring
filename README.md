## 📦 What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes (K8s)** is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

> Originally developed by Google, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛠 Automation             | Automates deployment, scaling, self-healing                                |
| 📦 Portability           | Works across cloud, on-prem, hybrid environments                           |
| 🚀 Speed & Efficiency     | Fast rollouts, rollbacks, and optimized resource usage                     |
| 🔐 Security              | Namespace isolation, RBAC, network policies                                |
| 🔄 Declarative Approach  | Uses YAML/JSON to describe infrastructure                                   |

## ⚙️ How Kubernetes Works (Components Overview)

| Component        | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pod**          | Smallest deployable unit (can contain one or more containers)        |
| **Service**      | Exposes pods via ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer                |
| **Deployment**   | Manages desired pod state, scaling, rollouts                         |
| **Ingress**      | HTTP/HTTPS routing with domain-based access                          |
| **ConfigMap**    | Injects configuration into containers                                |
| **Secret**       | Securely passes sensitive data (like passwords, keys)                |
| **Scheduler**    | Decides which node runs a pod                                        |
| **Kubelet**      | Runs on each node to manage container lifecycle                      |
| **Etcd**         | Key-value store for cluster state data                               |

## ⏰ When to Use Kubernetes

✅ Use Kubernetes when:

- You have **microservices or containerized apps**
- You need **scalability**, **auto-healing**, and **rolling updates**
- You deploy across **cloud/on-prem** platforms
- You want **infrastructure as code**

❌ Avoid Kubernetes if:

- You have **simple monolithic apps** with no scaling or orchestration needs
- You lack the team experience or **devops maturity**
- You just need one container (Docker alone is enough)

## 🆚 Traditional vs Kubernetes Deployment

| Feature            | Traditional Deployment                 | Kubernetes Deployment                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Setup              | Manual provisioning (SSH, scripts)     | Declarative YAML (`kubectl apply`)      |
| Scaling            | Manual server upgrades                 | Horizontal auto-scaling                 |
| Fault Recovery     | Manual restart                         | Auto-restarts unhealthy pods            |
| Load Balancing     | External hardware/software             | Native services and ingress             |
| CI/CD Integration  | Custom scripts                         | Native support + GitOps tools           |
| Port Mapping       | Manually via firewall or nginx.conf    | NodePort / LoadBalancer services        |
| Monitoring         | Separate tooling                       | Integrated via Prometheus, Grafana      |

└── nginx-k8s-deployment/
    ├── nginx-pod-service.yaml   # NGINX Deployment File 
    └── README.md

## 🚀 How to Deploy NGINX on Kubernetes

### 📝 Step 1: Create YAML file

```bash
nano nginx-pod-service.yaml
````

Paste this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod-service.yaml
```

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc nginx-service
```

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Access NGINX

#### Minikube:

```bash
minikube service nginx-service
```

#### Docker Desktop / kind:

Open: `http://localhost:<NodePort>`
(Use port from `kubectl get svc` output)

---

## 🧼 Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f nginx-pod-service.yaml
```
